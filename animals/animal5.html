        Facts about the Red lipped bafish<br>
      </h3>
      <p class ="textbox" style="font-size: 20px;">
      <p>
        Species:
Ogcocephalus darwini
      </p>
    <p>
      Habitat:
The red-lipped batfish dwells mainly in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. They are found in the vicinity of the Galápagos Islands, which lies on the equator and off the west coast of the South American continent. They are rarely found besides these islands, occasionally within the regions below Peru, one exception being recorded in Ecuador too.
<p>
  Appearance and Size:
  Batfish are said to possess certain features resembling a bat, which is why the name. With a light-brown to gray colored body, the batfish can only be identified from a crowd due to the characteristic red lips. They are bright-red, almost fluorescent in color. This feature is understood by marine biologists to be a mechanism to enhance species recognition during spawning (breeding).

<p>
  Adaptations of Galápagos Batfish:
Although a deep-water fish, it does not know how to swim well. So, a red-lipped batfish straight away walks on the ocean floor. It is identified with this peculiarity, as it possesses highly altered pectoral fins that aid walking. On maturity, the dorsal fin turns into a spine-like projection, extending from the head. This illicium is known to be used by the fish to attract prey; also a similarity with other anglerfish. Esca present at the end of the illicium sends out bright light, which in deep waters easily attracts smaller fish, serving as food for the batfish.
