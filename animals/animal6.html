        Profile: the “Penis Snake” (Update Nov 7, 2013)
        <p>
Species: Atretochoana eiselti is a type of caecilian, a limbless amphibian.
</p>
<p>
Habitat and range: The “penis snake” has been found in Brazil near the mouth of the Amazon and in the Madeira River (the largest tributary of the Amazon River). Both are considered “white-water” rivers, with limited visibility due to high silt loads. It is presently unknown what other rivers the “penis snake” inhabits and whether it occurs upstream in Peru or Bolivia.
</p>
Size: Lengths of 81 cm (32 inches) have been documented
<p>
Feeding habits: Like other caecilians, the “penis snake” likely feeds on small fish, worms, and other aquatic invertebrates. But more research is needed
</P>
First discovered: Atretochoana eiselti was first described in 1968 paper published in The Caecilians of the World. Its “rediscovery” was published in 1998.
<p>
Related species: Atretochoana eiselti is the only species in the genus Atretochoana, but another caecilian — Caecilita iwokramae — is also known to lack lungs. There are nearly 200 species of caecilian known worldwide, including a superficially similar one discovered in French Guiana in 2013.
</p>
<p>
Origin of the name: Mongabay.com coined the name “penis snake” in the August 1, 2012 post above. Since then, other media outlets have come up with some creative monikers including the “manaconda” and the “floppy snake”.
